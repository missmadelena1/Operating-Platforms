# Operating-Platforms


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   
The Gaming Room was out client who needed our assistance on extending platforms for it's current game, Draw It or Lose It. The game was currently only available on Android devices, and The Gaming Room needed out assistance in order to scale and bring the game web-base to work on many platforms. As a brief overview of the game, each round of 4 is 1-minute long and teams have 30 seconds to figure out what a drawing could be. If that 30 seconds surpasses, the other team would have 15 seconds to figure out the drawing to score. There were some requirements The Gaming Room needed for their game, which was that more than one team plays, each team with many players, no same team name and one game to be played at a time. This is shown in the UML diagram. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did very well with the UML diagram! I took accounting in my previous undergrad, so the UML was the easiest to do and I loved seeing the diagram of how the game is organized. 
    
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document is very helpful because it streamlines every requirement needed before developing the code. It helps us to realign if we fall off and gives us a strong foundation for code development. We look at the document as a BluePrint of the project and developing the code. 
    
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I would revise the evalutation portion of the document because it wasnt as organized or explained very well. It shows bullet points instead of explanations like I usually do. 
    
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's neeeds and implemented them into my software design by repeatedly going back to the document to realign what the client's needs are and always double checking if my work aligns with their requirements. Working on developing the game is easy, but it is also very easy to fall off and go off track as well. We must realign to the mission and think about the client and the client's end user. It is easy for us to work on things we believe is "cool" or a great idea, but we must evaluate if it is our biases and if it favors the client and their initial ask. Considering the user;s needs when deigning is crucial. We can have a perfect design, but if it doesnt meet the needs of the end-users, the project is toad and would be deemed as unsuccessful. 1
    
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software using the template we were given. I love templates because they helped me stay organized and allowed all the information to flow in one file instead of searching for past work to realign to new assignments. I also did object-oriented, so aligning those two together helps me stay organized and helps me avoid any errors and missed work.
